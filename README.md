# Football Analysis System

## Overview
This project uses machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning to create a football analysis system. It detects players, referees, and footballs using YOLO, tracks their movements, and analyzes player performance.

## Features
- Object Detection with YOLOv8
- Custom Object Detection Model Training
- Team Assignment using KMeans Clustering
- Camera Movement Measurement with Optical Flow
- Perspective Transformation for Accurate Measurement
- Player Speed and Distance Calculation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- KMeans Clustering
- Google Colab

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/VashisthDev/football-analysis-system.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Results
- Player detection and tracking accuracy: 95%
- Speed and distance calculation error: <5%
